# GravityAssist

GravityAssist is an infinite runner game I originally made on a game development course, but I didn't like the original engine so I decided to remake it using [Godot](https://godotengine.org). The game's idea is to control a spaceship by only inverting gravity. Also, I'm fully aware the code is horrible.
